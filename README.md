## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flosrn/myposter.ai.git
```

2. Change to the project directory:

```bash
cd myposter.ai
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

4. Copy the \`.env.template\` file and rename it to \`.env\`:

```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

5. Generate a `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` using a random string generator or a password
   manager. You can also generate one using a command like:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

6. To obtain `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, follow these steps:

   - Go to
     the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select an existing one
   - Click on "Credentials" in the left-hand menu
   - Click on "Create credentials" and select "OAuth client ID"
   - Choose "Web application" as the Application type
   - Set the "Authorized JavaScript origins" to `http://localhost:3000` for
     local development
   - Set the "Authorized redirect URIs"
     to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`
   - Click "Create" to generate your `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
     and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`

7. For the rest of the environment variables, such as `DATABASE_URL`,
   Stripe-related variables, and Uploadcare, please send DM to the main maintainer
   of the project ([flosrn](https://github.com/flosrn)).

8. Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the
